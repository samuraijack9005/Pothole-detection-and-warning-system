# Pothole-detection-and-warning-system
pothole detection using image processing and ultrasonic sensors.rasberry pi 3 b plus is used to implement this project.
before coding various modules should be installed in python ide such as GPIO.Rpi, opencv etc.
both the image and sensor module detects the pothole and warns the driver of the pothole prior.
while gps coordinates are stored on stationary CSV file which is a valuable data regarding road condition.
